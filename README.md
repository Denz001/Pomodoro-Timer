# Pomodoro-Timer
A very basic pomodoro timer that is good for 25 minutes. I thank W3Schools and Youtube for making the javascipt make sense. 

How to use:

<ul>
<li>To run the timer, click on the biggest circle. It changes color when you hover over it.</li>
<li>To pause the timer, press the pause button on the upper right side of the large circle. It changes color when you hover over it.</li>
<li>To resume the timer, click the largest circle again.</li>
</ul>
